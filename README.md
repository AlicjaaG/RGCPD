Features
=====

The basic idea behind RG-CPD was to create a python package which can process 3-dimensional data such that relationships based on correlation can be tested for causality.

Causal inference metrics has been proven a valuable to go beyond defining a relationship only by looking at e.g. correlation. Tigramite has been applied to 1 dimensional time series in climate science (See Kretschmer et al. 2016 10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0654.1).

Within RG-CPD, the 1-d precursor time series are obtained by creating point-wise correlation maps and subsequently grouping adjacent significantly correlating gridcells together into precursor regions. These precursor regions are then converted into 1-d time series by taking a spatial mean (see Kretschmer et al. 2017 10.1002/2017GL074696).

The final step is the same, where the 1-d time series are processed by Tigramite to extract the causal relationships. This requires thorough understanding of the method, see Runge et al. 2017 http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07007) These 1d time series contain more information since they are spatially aggregated. The 1d time series of different precursor regions and subsequently tested for causality using the Tigramite package.  


Installation
===========


Installation Anaconda3, python 3.6.1 environment

Installing in conda base_root 
----------------------
conda install spyder=3.3.1\
conda config --add channels conda-forge\
conda config --append channels bioconda\
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib cartopy xarray netCDF4 ecmwfapi scipy seaborn netcdftime cyordereddict\
conda install -c conda-forge nco


If you want to install this package in an environment this will not work since it will automatically install Tigramite to your root site-package e.g. ~anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/. And running Spyder from source activate <env> will point to the site-packages in your env folder ~/anaconda/envs/<env_name>/lib/python3.6/site-packages, not your root (thus it will not find the tigramite module). 
To solve this you could do:

Installing in conda env 
----------------------
Easy way:\
conda create --name <env_name> --file conda_env.txt \
More typing way, but probably cleaner: \
conda config --add channels conda-forge \
conda config --append channels bioconda\
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.6 numpy pandas matplotlib cartopy xarray netCDF4 ecmwfapi scipy seaborn netcdftime cyordereddict pip 


ECWMF MARS API
----------------
If you did not have ecmwfapi installed before, you need to create an ecmwf account and copy your key into the file .ecmwfapirc in your home directory. This will look like this: \
{\
    "url"   : "https://api.ecmwf.int/v1",\
    "key"   : <your key>,\
    "email" : <your emailadress>\
}


Installing Tigramite
----------------
To install Tigramite, see https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite \
If you install Tigramite on your base_root in conda, it will satisfy to download the tigramite-master folder and run \
python setup.py install .

Installing Tigramite in conda env:
----------------
Source activate <env_name> \
Git clone https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite.git \
pip install ./tigramite
