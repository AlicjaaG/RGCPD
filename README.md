Features
=====

RG-CPD is a framework to process 3-dimensional climate data, such that relationships based on correlation can be tested for conditional independence, i.e. causality.

Causal inference frameworks have been proven valuable by going beyond defining a relationship based upon correlation. Autocorrelation, common drivers and indirect drivers are very common in the climate system, and they lead to spurious (significant) correlations. Tigramite has been successfully applied to 1 dimensional time series in climate science (Kretschmer et al. 2016 https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0654.1), in order to filter out these spurious correlations using conditional indepence tests (Runge et al. 2017 http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07007).

Within RG-CPD, the 1-d precursor time series are obtained by creating point-wise correlation maps and subsequently grouping adjacent significantly correlating gridcells together into precursor regions. These precursor regions are then converted into 1-d time series by taking a spatial mean (Kretschmer et al. 2017 https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074696).

The final step is the same, where the 1-d time series are processed by Tigramite to extract the causal relationships. This requires thorough understanding of the method, see Runge et al. 2017 http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07007). These 1d time series contain more information since they are spatially aggregated. The 1d time series of different precursor regions are subsequently tested for causality using the Tigramite package (https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite). One has to have good knowledge about the assumptions needed for causal inference, https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5025050.

Installation
===========
If depencies are correct, then all scripts should work. Please use the .yml file to create a new conda environment. Afterwards, Tigramite is installed from github.


### Create conda environment:
conda env create -f RGCPD37.yml \
conda activate RGCPD \
Git clone https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite.git \
pip install ./tigramite 



## Optional:
### ECWMF MARS API (for ERA-i)
----------------
If you did not have ecmwfapi installed before, you need to create an ecmwf account and copy your key into the file .ecmwfapirc in your home directory. See https://confluence-test.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+MARS#AccessMARS-downloadmars. This will look like this:
 \
{
\
    "url"   : "https://api.ecmwf.int/v1",
\
    "key"   : <your key>,\
    "email" : <your emailadress>\
}
