Testing condition sets of dimension 0:

    Link (3ts -1) --> 3ts (1/2):
    Combination 0:  --> pval = 0.00000 / val = 0.267
    No conditions of dimension 0 left.

    Link (3ts -2) --> 3ts (2/2):
    Combination 0:  --> pval = 0.00001 / val = 0.140
    No conditions of dimension 0 left.

    Sorting parents in decreasing order with 
    weight(i-tau->j) = min_{iterations} |I_{ij}(tau)| 

Updating parents:

    Variable 3ts has 2 parent(s):
        (3ts -1): max_pval = 0.00000, min_val = 0.267
        (3ts -2): max_pval = 0.00001, min_val = 0.140

Testing condition sets of dimension 1:

    Combination 0: (3ts -2)  --> pval = 0.00000 / val = 0.240
    No conditions of dimension 1 left.

    Link (3ts -2) --> 3ts (2/2):
    Combination 0: (3ts -1)  --> pval = 0.01888 / val = 0.073
    No conditions of dimension 1 left.
